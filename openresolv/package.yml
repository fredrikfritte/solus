summary    : resolv.conf management framework (resolvconf)
description: |
    Enter resolvconf, the middleman between the network configuration services and /etc/resolv.conf. resolvconf itself is just a script that stores, removes and lists a full resolv.conf generated for the interface. It then calls all the helper scripts it knows about so it can configure the real /etc/resolv.conf and optionally any local nameservers other than libc.
